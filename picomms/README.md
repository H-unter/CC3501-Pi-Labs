# Example Linux programs using the sockets API and libcurl

These are a set of example applications that use TCP and UDP sockets as well as libcurl. They are intended as educational examples for students learning to write Linux network applications.

To compile the http client, you will need libcurl to be installed, with something like:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```
